# TypeScript Happy Forward Ref

import ExportMetaInfo from '../components/export-meta-info';

<ExportMetaInfo />

Make React's `forwardRef` works with TypeScript in case:

- You want to make a polymorphic component with forwarded ref
- You want to pass generic type to `forwardRef`
- You have encountered a strange typescript quirk when an interface function object can not be nested

## Usage

Below is an example that uses `typescriptHappyForwardRef` to create a polymorphic button component with forwarded ref.

```tsx copy
import { typescriptHappyForwardRef } from 'foxact/typescript-happy-forward-ref';

export type ButtonProps<T extends React.ElementType> = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<T> & { as?: T };

const Button = typescriptHappyForwardRef(<E extends React.ElementType>({ as, ...rest }: ButtonProps<E>, ref: React.ForwardedRef<any>) => {
  const Comp = as || 'button';

  return <Comp {...rest} ref={ref} />;
});
```
