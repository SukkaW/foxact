# Best Practice

## Destructuring

Some of the React Hooks in `foxact` will return **an object of memoized values**. You can use [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to extract the values you need, e.g:

```tsx
import { useClipboard } from 'foxact/use-clipboard';

export default function App() {
  const { copied, copy } = useClipboard();
  const handleCopyButtonClick = useCallback(() => copy('Hello World'), [copy]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleCopyButtonClick}>{copied ? 'Copied' : 'Copy Hello World'}</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here, the `copy` function returned by `useClipboard` is memoized, so it's safe to use it as a dependency in the `useCallback` hook.

Other more re-usable utilities and hooks from `foxact` will return **an array of memoized values**, so you can give them a more descriptive name by using [array destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Array_destructuring), e.g:

```tsx
// src/context/provider.tsx
import { createContextState } from 'foxact/context-state';

const [TokenProvider, useToken, useSetToken] = createContextState<string | null>(null);
const [SidebarActiveProvider, useSidebarActive, useSetSidebarActive] = createContextState(false);

const Provider = ({ children }: React.PropsWithChildren) => (
  <TokenProvider>
    <SidebarActiveProvider>
      {children}
    </SidebarActiveProvider>
  </TokenProvider>
);

export {
  Provider,
  useToken, useSetToken,
  useSidebarActive, useSetSidebarActive
};

// src/App.tsx
import { useIntersection } from 'foxact/use-intersection';

const [setAvatarIntersection, isAvatarIntersected, resetAvatarIsIntersected] = useIntersection<HTMLImageElement>();
const [setThumbnailIntersection, isThumbnailIntersected, resetThumbnailIsIntersected] = useIntersection<HTMLImageElement>();
const setToken = useSetToken();
```

And returned functions (like `setAvatarIntersection`, `resetAvatarIsIntersected`, `setThumbnailIntersection`, `resetThumbnailIsIntersected`, and `setToken`) are always memoized, so it's safe to add them to any dependencies array.

## Why / Why not

### Global state management library vs useContext + useState

Global state management libraries (like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) or [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)) usually store the state outside of React, then use `useSyncExternalState` to sync the state into the React.

`useSyncExternalState` is a new React built-in hook introduced in React 18. It is a trade-off between React Concurrent Rendering and consistency (without tearing). Currently (React 18.2), when React encounters `useSyncExternalState` during the concurrent rendering, React will "de-optimize" and fall back to the synchronous rendering (slower and less responsive) to make sure there is no inconsistency (tearing). Only states stored inside of React (using `useState` and `useReducer`) are concurrent-rendering-friendly.

Global state management libraries are indeed very powerful and great for React application that has complex logic and complicated data flow. But most of the time, a simple state shared across the application is good enough.

### Why not `useIsMounted`

It is common to use `useIsMounted` to check if the component is mounted before calling `setState` during `useEffect`:

```tsx
// ONLY FOR DEMONSTRATION, NEVER DO THIS IN REAL WORD REACT PROJECT
const isMountedRef = useIsMountedRef();

useEffect(() => {
  someAsyncStuff().then(data => {
    if (isMountedRef.current) {
      // trying to avoid set state on unmounted component
      setData(data);
      // BUT NO, DO NOT TO THIS. THIS IS WRONG
    }
  });
});
```

The real problem is that you are trying to avoid is not updating the state after the component has been unmounted, but **what you really should do** is to avoid updating the state after the current effect has been unsubscribed / cleanup-ed.

Imagine this common race condition:

```tsx
interface ExampleComponentProps {
  dataKey: 'data1' | 'data2'
}

const ExampleComponent = ({ dataKey }: ExampleComponentProps) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  // ONLY FOR DEMONSTRATION, NEVER DO THIS IN REAL WORD REACT PROJECT
  const isMountedRef = useIsMountedRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    someAsyncStuff(dataKey).then(data => {
      if (isMountedRef.current) {
        // trying to avoid set state on unmounted component
        setData(data);
        // BUT NO, DO NOT TO THIS. THIS IS WRONG
      }
    });
  }, [dataKey]);

  return (
    <div>{data}</div>
  );
};
```

```
│ Request data 1 ────────────────────────────────────────► data1 response (setData(data1)) │
           │ Request data 2 ────► data2 response (setData(data2)) │
```

Here, although the request for `data1` happened before `data2`, the response for `data2` is received before `data1`. And `useIsMountedRef` doesn't help with that.

To properly avoid `setData(data1)` from being called, the correct pattern is:

```tsx
interface ExampleComponentProps {
  dataKey: 'data1' | 'data2'
}

const ExampleComponent = ({ dataKey }: ExampleComponentProps) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    let isCancelled = false;

    someAsyncStuff().then(data => {
      if (!isCancelled) {
        setData(data);
      }
    });

    return () => {
      isCancelled = true;
    };
  }, [dataKey]);
}
```

```
│ Request data 1 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────► data1 response │
| isCancelled: false    | isCancelled: true                                              | isCancelled: true, no setData(data1)
                        │ Request data 2 ────► data2 response (setData(data2)) │
                        | isCancelled: false                                   | isCancelled: false, setData(data2)
```
