React's error boundaries feature is limited in that the boundaries can only handle errors thrown during React's rendering. So any error that happens inside event handlers or `useEffect` are not caught by the error boundaries. `useErrorBoundary` is useful when you want to reuse existing error boundaries for those errors.

## Usage

```tsx
import useSWR from 'swr';
import { fetcher } from '@/lib/fetcher';
import { useErrorBoundary } from 'foxact/use-error-boundary';

const Demo = () => {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/_sukka/api', fetcher);

  // Trigger error boundary when SWR returns a non-null "error"
  useErrorBoundary(error);
  // Note that this is just an example to demonstrate the usage of useErrorBoundary
  // It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use SWR with "useErrorBoundary" since SWR has a built-in automatic error retry.
  // If an error boundary is triggered by "useErrorBoundary", its children along with the SWR will be unmounted,
  // then no more SWR auto retry and error recovery.

  return (
    <div />
  )
}

const App = () => (
  <ErrorBoundary>
    <Demo />
  </ErrorBoundary>
);
```

```tsx
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import { useErrorBoundary } from 'foxact/use-error-boundary';

const Demo = () => {
  const triggerErrorBoundary = useErrorBoundary();
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    try {
      // Do something
    } catch (e) {
      triggerErrorBoundary(e);
    }
  }, [triggerErrorBoundary]); // triggerErrorBoundary is memoized and is safe to add to the dependency array

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>submit</button>
  )
}
```
