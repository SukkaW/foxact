# Create localStorage State

import ExportMetaInfo from '../components/export-meta-info';

<ExportMetaInfo />

Store your shared state that lives in localStorage and synchronize the state of a component with the data stored in the `localStorage`. Lift your state up and passing them deeply into your React app without worrying about performance.

## Usage

First, create a shared hooks with `createLocalStorageState`. It is recommended to place them in a separate file:

```tsx filename="src/context/sidebar-active.tsx" copy
import { createLocalStorageState } from 'foxact/create-local-storage-state';

const [useSidebarActive, useSidebarActiveValue] = createLocalStorageState(
  'sidebar-active', // The localStorage key
  /**
   * The initial value to use if there is no item in the local storage with the provided key,
   * the undefined value will be used if no initial value is provided.
   *
   * Also, the initial value will also be used during the server-side rendering, see below.
   */
  false,
  /**
   * Optional configuration object enables the customization of value serialization before it's stored in local storage.
   */
  {
    // Optional, default to false. When set to "true", the value will be passed to the localStorage API as is.
    raw: false,
    // Optional, default to "JSON.stringify". Can only be specified when the "raw" is set to false (which is the default).
    serializer: JSON.stringify,
    // Optional, default to "JSON.parse". Can only be specified when the "raw" is set to false (which is the default).
    deserializer: JSON.parse,
  }
);

export { useSidebarActive, useSidebarActiveValue };
```

And now you can use the getter and setter hooks anywhere in your app:

```tsx filename="src/components/sidebar.tsx" copy
import { memo } from 'react';
import { useSidebarActive, useSidebarActiveValue } from '../context/sidebar-active';

function Sidebar() {
  const [sidebarActive, setSidebarActive] = useSidebarActive();
  // If you only need the value, you can use `useSidebarActiveValue` instead:
  const sidebarActive = useSidebarActiveValue();

  return (
    <div className={`sidebar ${sidebarActive ? 'active' : ''}`}>
      <button onClick={() => setSidebarActive(false)}>Close Sidebar</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default memo(Sidebar);
```

## Sever-side Rendering

If the second argument (the initial value) is provided, React will use the initial value to render the UI and generate HTML on the server, otherwise React will find the closest `<Suspense>` boundary and render its `fallback` UI into the generated server HTML on the server. See 
[`useLocalStorage`](/use-local-storage#sever-side-rendering) for more information.
